/* One indexable page per engineering discipline.

 * one page however many roles are on it, and someone searching "civil
 * engineering jobs" has nothing specific to land on. This gives each
 * discipline its own server-rendered URL with the roles in the HTML.
 *
 * Hourly ISR rather than fully static: roles open and close on their own
 * (the Top Echelon sync closes filled ones), and a landing page listing a
 * role that's gone is worse than a slightly stale one. */

 * cached and served with HTTP 200, i.e. a soft 404. Google treats those as
 * thin duplicates and they quietly eat crawl budget. Switching it off makes
 * the router reject unknown slugs before any of this runs.
 *
 * The trade-off: a discipline or state that gains its first role won't have
 * a page until the next deploy. Its roles are still on /jobs and on the
 * other axis's page, so nothing is hidden — and a deploy follows any sync
 * worth publishing. */
