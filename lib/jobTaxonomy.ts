/* Turns the job board into browsable landing pages — one per discipline and
 * one per state.
 *
 * Why these exist: /jobs is a single client-rendered page behind filters, so
 * search engines see one URL no matter how many roles are on it. Someone
 * searching "civil engineering jobs texas" has nothing to land on. These
 * pages give each real query its own indexable URL, built from data the
 * board already holds.
 *
 * Everything here is derived from live jobs rather than from a fixed list,
 * so a page only exists while it has roles on it. An empty landing page is
 * worse than no page: it wastes crawl budget and reads as abandoned.
